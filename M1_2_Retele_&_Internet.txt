Basics of Networks and Internet


For the beginning of the lesson we will install Fing app on mobile phone or pc/laptop and scan the Wi-Fi network
We can see the connected devices and the IP address of that devices. 
Also with Fing we can see and track other people's devices if they are connected to a Wi-Fi network. 
After the scan we will se the devices in the network and the router.
The router connects our LAN Network with the internet
The main topic in this module is the IP addresses private/public, router, LAN and ISP. 
I already know the difference between private and public IP. I know what is a router, I know what is a LAN network, and ISP. 
Another term is WAN which means Wide Area Network. 

The above part I already covered in M1_1_Bazele_Reteleleor
