Basics of Networks and Internet


For the beginning of the lesson we will install Fing app on mobile phone or pc/laptop and scan the Wi-Fi network
We can see the connected devices and the IP address of that devices. 
Also with Fing we can see and track other people's devices if they are connected to a Wi-Fi network. 
After the scan we will se the devices in the network and the router.
The router connects our LAN Network with the internet
The main topic in this module is the IP addresses private/public, router, LAN and ISP. 
I already know the difference between private and public IP. I know what is a router, I know what is a LAN network, and ISP. 
Another term is WAN which means Wide Area Network. 

The above part I already covered in M1_1_Bazele_Reteleleor


OSI Model - 7 Layers

OSI Model           Protocols and Services        TCP/IP Model

1  Physical        Ethernet, Fi-Fi                Link
2  Datalink
3  Network          IP,ARP, ICMP                  Internet
4  Transport       TCP/UDP                        Transport
5  Session         HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DHCP, PNG    Application
6  Presentation
7  Application


After this I installed Wireshark and watched the traffic in the Wi-Fi network. 

The next discussed topic is ARP which means Address Resolution Protocol 
In LAN without ARP the communication is not possible because in LAN the communication is established between MAC so for IP address A it will be assigned MAC address A and after that the communication in LAN will be MAC based. 

After all this the homework is: Start wireshark as admin, Scan the network traffic and make a screenshot, scan the traffic with TCP filter, HTTP filter and ARP filter. Make a screenshot for each instance. 


Next main topic is: Network simulate with Cisco Packet Tracer

After install and login in Cisco Packet Tracer create a network composing of 1 router 2911, one switch 2960, one pc and one laptop. 
Connect them with a direct cable as: a direct connection from pc to switch. Another direct connection from laptop to switch and another direct connection from switch to router. The switch and router should be connected with gigabit port. 
after the connections , click on the router and choose CLI to configure the router. 
type ? and press enter to see the options available to the router> menu. 
type enable to log in to the privileged mode. The router> is representing user mode. The router# is representing privileged mode. 
In privileged mode we have access to more functions of the router. Type ? to see the commands available to privileged mode
As an example if we type show version - it will show the version of OS for the router.
If we type show ip interface brief - it will show all the gigabit connections interfaces  
If we want to change the name of the router we need to type: config terminal and the router will enter in config mode
Type hostname R1 to change the name from the router to R1 
!!! In the config mode we can make any modification to the router. 

Now let's set up an ip address for the router.
in config terminal command type interface ? to see al the interface commands or type interface Gig0/0 to access that interface 
after that in R1 (config-if)# type  ip address 192.168.1.1 ? with space after and ? this and  config the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0 and press enter. 

after this to start the router you need to type: no shutdown (some commands need to be negated to start an option or the device)


Now we will extend the exercise with another router and a server. The connection between the router and the server must be made with a crossover cable instead of straight connection. In the case of two identical equipment's, the connection must be made with a crossover cable. Even if the router and the server are not identical, the connection pins are identical that meaning that a crossover connection is needed. 

Now for the setup.
On R1 we type:
enable if we are in R1> mode
conf t(we can use shortcuts)
int Gig0/2
ip address 89.123.45.1 ? 255.255.255.0 
no sh (instead of no shutdown command to start that port/interface)

Now for the next router
enable
conf t
hostname R2 
int Gig0/2
ip address 89.123.45.2 ? 255.255.255.0 
no sh
end(to exit to R1# mode) 
ping 89.123.45.1 and we will need to have a ok connection. 
conf t
int Gig0/1 
ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
no sh

On the server we go to desktop - ip configuration 
ip address 10.0.0.2
subnet mask 255.255.255.0
default gateway 10.0.0.1

Now we can test with a ping from 10.0.0.2 to 10.0.0.1 

if we test with a ping from the pc 192.168.1.2 to 10.0.0.2 we will get host unreachable because there is no connection between the routers. This means that R1 doesn't know how to reach the LAN of R2 and vice versa. 

Now we go on R1 and type
show ip int brief
show ip route (this will show the routing interface) 
conf t
int Gig0/2
ip route 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 89.123.45.2  (this will add the route of the data trough router 2)


Now we go on R2 and type:
conf t
int Gig0/1
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 89.123.45.1
